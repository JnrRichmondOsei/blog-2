        With most recognized professions like law or accounting, specific educational credentials and licenses are legally required to be 
        eligible to work in the field (Lee, Michelle. The Rise of Amateur journalism and its implications, lane Publishers, 2019). 
        For example, one cannot practice medicine without am M.D. But journalism has no such mandates –  no degrees’ certificate or 
        licensing exams are prerequisites for employment as a reporter. 
        This open access implies journalism is not a true regulated profession.

        Many established professions such as law and medicine command strong public respect and trust but people 
        are often skeptical about the credibility of journalism (Thompson James, The Erosion of Journalistic integrity. Credibility, 
        Trust and the professions Image Journey Books, 2018), For instance, polls show doctors are trusted much than journalist. 
        This lack of prestige weakens the assertion that journalism has the same professional standing

        Journalism has expensive constitutional right that allow substantial freedom compared to 
        regulated professions governed by statues that impose standards and constraints 
        (Clark Jennifer Journalism: Protected. Not Professional Legal Books, 2020). For instance, lawyers and doctors are legally restricted
        in many ways journalists are not. 
        These legal protections for journalism set it apart from accredited professions.

          Timothy E. Cook in “Governing with the news: The news media as a political institution” – 
          Cook examines the relationship between the news media and political power, 
          arguing that journalism often serves the interests of those in power rather than 
          adhering to the principles of a true profession.

          Michael Schudson in “Discovering the news: A social History of American Newspaper”. 
          Schudson discussed how journalism as a profession due to its lack of formal credentially requirements and standardized ethical codes.
          These books show the perspectives that journalism is not a profession. But journalism is a profession or 
          not depend on how they are able to accept the challenges of today.
